# Neural Wavelet-domain Diffusion for 3D Shape Generation [ACM TOG 2023]

![teaser](imgs/teaser.png)

For environment setup and dataset preparation, we follow [Wavelet-Generation](https://github.com/edward1997104/Wavelet-Generation). 

# Training

To be released soon

# Inference

We provided our pre-trained models for our method and the tested data for shape inversion. 

You can run the inference by running:

```python
python eval_con_diffusion.py
```
